## Summary
This data package is associated with the publication “Non-random processes impacting organic matter chemistry are maximized in mid-order stream” submitted to Science Advances by Danczak et al., (in-review).

This study applies meta-metabolome ecology to investigate processes influence DOM chemical variability along the river continnum across 47 sites within the Yakima River Basin (YRB). The data used in this study are publicly available on the Environmental System Science Data Infrastructure for a Virtual Ecosystem (ESS-DIVE) data repository at [doi:10.15485/1898914](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1898914)
